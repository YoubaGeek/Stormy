A single page weather app for android

This is just a side project for fun and it's free to use :)

I'm using Android Studio as and IDE to develop this app.

I'm using forecast.io to have JSON data of weather it's free to use, try it!!

Note that the location provided into the application is dynamic but is not exactly the same place you are (for me for example I'm in WÃ¼rzburg and it tells me Berlin ) that's because I took the location from the API of forecast.

If you want to change it there is a several way to do it :)


Happy coding!
