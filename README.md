A single page weather app for android

This is just a side project for fun and it's free to use :)

I'm using Android Studio as  IDE to develop this app and testing with my smartphone but if you want a good emulator I recommend Genymotion.

I'm using forecast.io to have JSON data of weather it's free to use, try it!!

//Note that the location provided into the application is dynamic but is not exactly the same place you are (for me for example //I'm in WÃ¼rzburg and it tells me Berlin ) that's because I took the location from the API of forecast.

==>Updated using Geocoder to get the exact location name of the user.

If you want to change it there is a several way to do it :)


Happy coding!
